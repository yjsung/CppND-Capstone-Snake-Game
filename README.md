2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## Game Rule
1. If snake eat the food, snake's body will grow and you'll get 1 point. 
2. Every time when snake eat the food, snake's speed will be faster.
3. If snake hit the wall or itself then game is over.
